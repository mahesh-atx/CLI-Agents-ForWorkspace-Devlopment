# CLI-Agents-ForWorkspace-Development

🚀 **DevAI** — An autonomous CLI-based AI software engineer that understands your codebase, plans changes, writes code, and auto-fixes errors.

## Features

- **Smart Context Selection** — Automatically reads and prioritizes relevant project files
- **Multi-Model Support** — Works with multiple AI models via configurable API clients
- **Conversation Memory** — Remembers context across multi-turn interactions
- **Image Analysis** — Supports multimodal inputs for UI/screenshot analysis
- **Surgical Patching** — Applies search/replace edits instead of overwriting entire files
- **Self-Debugger Loop** — Automatically runs build/test, captures errors, and fixes them autonomously
- **Project Detection** — Auto-detects React, Express, Node, Python, and static web projects

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
node devai.js
```

## Commands

| Command        | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/build`       | Run build/test and auto-fix any errors               |
| `/build <cmd>` | Set a custom build command (e.g., `/build npm test`) |
| `exit`         | Quit DevAI                                           |
